## Characteristics

- Data extraction from Wikipedia HTML tables using `pandas.read_html()`.
- Data cleaning and preparation: changing column names and data types.
- Identification and isolation of top 10 economies by Nominal GDP (according to IMF data).
- Basic visualization of the data (you can add this if you include graphs in the future).

## Technologies Used

This project was developed using the following technologies:

- **Python** (version 3.10).
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas** (for data manipulation and analysis)
- lxml** (for extraction of HTML tables)

## Usage

Once Jupyter Notebook is opened:

1.  **Run all cells in order** to replicate the data analysis. You can do this by selecting `Cell > Run All` in the Jupyter menu.
2.  Look at the outputs of each cell to see the extraction process, cleaning and the resulting DataFrames.
3.  The final DataFrame with the top 10 savings will be displayed at the end of the notebook.

## Results / Conclusions

This analysis provides a clean DataFrame with the world's top 10 economies by Nominal GDP, allowing for a quick overview of the economic leaders globally. The data was transformed for ease of use in further analysis or visualizations.
